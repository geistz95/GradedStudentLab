Chapter 4 - 9 notes

Class is a blueprint for an object
You are just describing of how to make an object
Objects can accept parameters to help define it.
Each class has methods or functions that help manipulate data about the object

Each object can accept parameters (Take data )and  return (give back information)

Cannot compare two things that aren't the same type

Methods are things that help manipulate data to, from, about the object

Java libraries

Another name for Java libraries are Java APIs

Java Libraries are already written code that you can use to help shorten your code.

ArrayLists can only take Objects. So primitive types do not work. If you wanna use doubles you will need to write Double

& and && are different since & checks both sides and && checks left if its true first then right, but to the left of && is false, it stops right there, same logic applies to | and ||

Inheritance makes it so that you can stem objects off of other objects

Inheritance is practice when a child class (a sub class) is made from a parent ( a super class) 

A child class IS a parent class but other way around is not true.

Dog is  Pet but Pet isn't a Dog

Overriding is basically you rewriting a piece of code for a certain child class because of different information needed to be given

Overloading means you can change the return type or parameters for your class
Overloading is not part of inheritance

The abstract keyword is an access modifier that makes it so that no Objects can be created from it.

Why? Because when we want to use an abstract keyboard, we may want it to define a general concept such as Pet

We do not have "Pet" as a pet but we can have dogs, cats, etc. So Pet is just a general skeleton.

You must override some of the functions in order for the subclasses to work

For example : Not all pets are the same breed, so you'll need to tailor things to fit that data.

INstanced variables are variables that are created inside of an object. Multiple objects have a "name" variable, but they all aren't the same value.

A Constructor is an initializing method that creates an object from certain defined parameters. When accepting that data, it creates a new object with the values that are sent in.

A default constructor is in place if you do not have one created

Overloading a constructor means you can accept different types of ways of creating an object, You need to have different set of parameters in order to make different constructors
